Please design a curriculum to teach a Humanoid robot to walk.
Start with simple tasks (e.g., just standing up) and progress to walking forward.
The final goal is to walk forward as fast as possible without falling.

Available variables to control:
- torso_z (height)
- forward_vel (x velocity)
- sideways_vel (y velocity)
- joint_angles
